## Instagram Node.js
Instagram's private API.
Based on awesome project [Instagram-API](https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API)

## Installation

    $ npm install instanode

## Testing

After install you can check how it work. Go to node_modules/instanode/test directory and make changes in *test.js* file.

```javascript
const TEST_USERNAME = 'PLACE_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE'; 
const TEST_PASSWORD = 'PLACE_YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE';
```

And run mocha test

    npm test

## Initializing

To use the library, you'll need to enter your Instagram username and password. We can't implement OAuth 
authentication be-course it is closed API.

```javascript
let Instanode = require('instanode');

let instaClient = new Instanode(YOUR_USERNAME, YOUR_PASSWORD);

instaClient.login((err, result) => {
    console.log(result); // This is user signature object. Save it for next use without additional login
});
```
    
After that, you can do other API calls.
Also you can just save *result* object as JSON string or other format and in next time use saved signature in instance

```javascript
let instaClient = new Instanode(userSignatureObject);
```

## Post a photo

It is very easy. Just make sure you have user-signature object or loggined instanode instance.
  
```javascript
instaClient.uploadPhoto(PATH_TO_PHOTO_JPG, {caption: 'Caption for this photo'}, (err, result) => {
    console.log(result); // Result should contain some information about new photo
});
```

If you have only saved user-signature and don't want use instance with signature, you can pass it as option

```javascript
instaClient.uploadPhoto(PATH_TO_PHOTO_JPG, {
    caption: 'Caption for this photo',
    userSignature: userSignature
  }, (err, result) => {
    console.log(result); // Result should contain some information about new photo
  });
```
